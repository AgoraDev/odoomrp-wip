Sale promotion gift
===================

This module allows you to create products and quantities of free gift in object
Pricelist Item Offers.

When a line is inserted into the sale order line, automatically free products 
are reflected in the new tab "Promotion gift products" of the sale order.

In this new tab when you click the button "Dump offer", defined as the product 
"Promotion gift products", they will be copied to the products defined as 
"Final gift products".

When you save the sale order, it will validate that the total of the 
category/quantity defined in "Final gift products", does not exceed to the 
total of the category/quantity defined in  "Promotion gift products".
